Absolutely! Below is a clean, practical **User Stories document** (`User-Stories.md`) for **MyOneView**, written in the standard **"As a... I want... So that..."** format. It’s organized by user role and feature area, making it ideal for agile planning, backlog grooming, or developer onboarding in your GitHub Wiki.

You can now save this as `User-Stories.md` in your GitHub Wiki. It pairs perfectly with your `Requirements.md` and `Vision.md`.

Would you like:
- **Acceptance Criteria** for each story?
- A **Prioritized MVP Backlog** (e.g., “Must-have vs. Nice-to-have”)?
- Or a **Wireframe/UX flow** outline?
